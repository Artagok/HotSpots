## ‚ö°Ô∏è Easy Incident Monitoring üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

We designed a web app that enables citizens to report incidents in real time as well as check the incidents around them.

The app has a 3 part architecture.

**MongoDB**

Database used to store user inputs with more information extracted from external APIs/DBs. 

**API**

The REST API currently acts as the main "controller" of the whole system. The API fetches and merges the external data when a user inputs new data.

**React Frontend**

We designed a highly functional app in React that lets the user easily report new events and check the events around them.
